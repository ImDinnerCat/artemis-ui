## What is Artemis UI?

Artemis UI is a user interface frontend framework that allows you to build a user interface without having to use (S)CSS or JS yourself. Artemis UI has utilities, such as the use of different paddings by means of classes. Also predefined UI elements can be used and customized.

Artemis UI is mainly used to make work faster, not to build a prefabricated interface.

## Installation

### Import as local files.
So far it is only possible to import Artemis UI as a local file. Just download the `/dist` folder, and import the `css` and `js` file into your project.

##### CSS Import
```html
<head>
  <!-- Import the Artemis UI CSS in the head tag. -->
  <link href="./dist/css/artemis-ui.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
  <!-- Below you can import your CSS. -->
  <link href="./assets/style.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
```

##### JS Import
```html
<body>
  <!-- Import the Artemis UI JS at the very bottom of the Body tag. -->
  <script src="./dist/js/artemis-ui.min.js"></script>
  <!-- Below that you can import your JS. -->
  <script src="./assets/index.js"></script>
</body>
```

### Import as local files.
At a later stage, when Artemis UI is in a higher version, I will also provide the possibility to include Artemis UI as NPM package or via a CDN. At the moment, it is not worth it.
