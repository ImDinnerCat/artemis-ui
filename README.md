### What is Artemis UI?

Artemis UI is a user interface frontend framework that allows you to build a user interface without having to use CSS or SCSS yourself. Artemis UI has utilities, such as the use of different paddings by means of classes. Also predefined UI elements can be used and customized.

Artemis UI is mainly used to make work faster, not to build a prefabricated interface.

### What features does Artemis UI offer?
#### Layout
- Containers
- Grid (with / without gutters)

#### Content
- Typography

#### Utilities
- Positions

- Sizing & Spacing
- Colors (Text, Background, Border) + Hover

## Installation
So far it is only possible to import Artemis UI as a local file. Download the min.css from the CSS folder in the repository and move it to your assets folder.

At a later stage, when Artemis is in a higher version, I will also provide the possibility to include Artemis UI as NPM package or via a CDN. At the moment, it is not worth it.

## Documentation
You can find documentation on Artemis UI at https://artemis-ui.dnrcat.net/.

There everything is described and explained in more detail. You can also find a live demo of how different pages can look with Artemis UI.
